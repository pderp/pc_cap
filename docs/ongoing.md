# Ongoing work (the single current log; previous versions are dated under `docs/archive/`)

Rewritten 2026-09-11 06:55 EDT, updated 2026-09-15 15:40 EDT (round 13 committed; round 14 lanes) by the orchestrating session for
the concurrent round of `docs/updated_plan7.md`. Previous version: `docs/archive/ongoing-2026-09-15-1540.md`. Rules §1 are
unchanged and restated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: JAX only, sibling/FabricPC read-only, resources under
`assets/`, **no commits by agents** (the lead commits; the orchestrator commits only when the lead asks),
task records in `docs/tasks/<ID>.md`, claim rows with the status tool or a claim JSON, lease for any GPU
use > 60 s, placeholder modules are the lane's to replace, other existing files need an edit request.
Board: `docs/tasks/STATUS.md`.

**Round 3 is evaluated (08:10 EDT).** V3 confirmed the five repairs; Lane X's P4 reproduction holds and its S7
findings are repaired; B4-S ran the sensitivity control, which did not reproduce the divergence class, so B4 stays
unregistered (DEC-020) while Codex localizes the first cross-framework gradient difference. Codex's round-4 lanes are
in §3 (B4-D in progress; S3-01, V4, P open). The lead has accepted the defaults for D-A/C/D/G/H (DEC-021…024); the
freeze command is posted in `docs/lead_queue.md` and waits only on the B4 deadline (2026-09-12 12:00 EDT). The orchestrator's next GPU use (B4 profile, one confirm-mode smoke job against the real base, the
GPU test subset) comes after Lane B4-S lands and is announced in `docs/lead_queue.md`; short `-m gpu` tests by
either agent need no lease.

**Post-freeze rule for every agent (from the moment `manifests/frozen.json` exists).** The freeze binds the hash of the
whole installed `src/pccap` tree; every confirm-mode job compares the tree at start and refuses on any difference (exit 2,
the queue stops). Therefore: no edits under `src/pccap/` after the freeze — not even in your own lane's files
(`src/pccap/baselines/grace_*.py` included). Put B4-D diagnostics and fixes in new files under `scripts/`, `logs/`,
`results/` or `docs/`, or as a proposed patch under `docs/tasks/`; a fix that must land in `src/pccap` is applied only with
a versioned manifest and `--allow-code-drift` recorded by the orchestrator (plan 4 §2). Tests under `tests/` and everything
outside `src/pccap` are unaffected.

**(17:56 EDT) The hold on `src/pccap/` is lifted: the v3 grammar rerun is finished and no confirm-mode job remains. New
modules go under `src/pccap/revision_v1/` as planned; anything drafted under `revision_v1_staging/` can move in.**

## 1. State (2026-09-14, 17:20 EDT)

- **v0 closed** (close-out identity `cb04d5e`); the lead's T4 review of the report/memo is still outstanding.
- **Revision v1, Stage 2 is done on the development side.** The learned reader (tied cosine + pairwise null + lexical
  overlap, stable observations, per-position deltas) with ordinary-text null training is reference condition v2; with the
  R1-56 rare-token overlap gate it is the proposed v3 (DEC-043). Development streams, three seeds: zsRE RET-GS 0.96–0.98,
  CounterFact 0.715–0.85, ES / RET-ES / LS 1.00; drift 0.000 / +0.012 nats; near-miss 100/100, revision 100/100; unseen
  edit-prompt false fires zsRE 10–11 % at 1,000 records (45 % without the gate), CounterFact 0 %. Report:
  `docs/R1_stage2_report.md`; running log `docs/R1_stage2_notes.md`; identities `manifests/revision_v1/primary_condition_v{1,2,3}.json`.
- **Costs measured on the real base** (R1-55, `results/R1/p1_profile/`): 1,000 records use 51–74 % of the state
  ceiling with exact restore; edit 0.07–0.13 s; query 10–15 ms; a full 1,000-edit cell with every endpoint at three
  checkpoints ≈ 1,150 s. Codex's 240-cell matrix v3 ≈ 92 h against the 15 h envelope; the lead keeps the full scope (DEC-044);
  ceilings will be set from the measured components.
- **Round 13 committed by Codex** (`c238f02`): register policy v5 (4,218 MQuAKE subjects), protocol v4, dev-loader and
  selection-trace modules (orchestrator wires them), R1-65/66 review (collision rate 2.1–2.3 %), R1-68 integrity components
  (partial). Clean driver profile: 1,252 s per 300-edit cell; 1,000-edit cell ≈ 49–66 min.
- **Primary condition v5** (DEC-049/050; `primary_condition_v5.json`): question-null family seed 2, averaged checkpoints 150–300;
  mean RET-GS 0.803 (zsRE 0.98 / CounterFact 0.82 / MQuAKE 0.61), ES 1.00, LS ≥ 0.98, zsRE unseen 10 / 12 / 9 % at
  100 / 300 / 1,000, near-miss 100/100, revision 100/100, full-assay drift +0.0022 nats. Driver: 1,262 s per 300-edit
  cell (overhead = per-phase clone/restore ≈ 545 s + one-at-a-time drift 506 s); the incremental profile changes nothing.
- **DEC-048 (option C)**: true-fact query presentations are not counterfactual-edit exposure; MQuAKE capacity 4,218 vs
  4,050 demand; full scope stands. **Round 12 committed by Codex** (`cee3d79`): population memo, protocol v3, matrix v4,
  MQuAKE counter-review (notes corrected). Reader status: fixed-locality readers (R1-65) keep retention (MQuAKE 0.79,
  zsRE 0.98, CounterFact 0.86) but zsRE unseen false fires stay 30–52 % at 100 records; question-form nulls (R1-66)
  bring them to 5 % at a retention cost; a 35 % rate and the clean driver profile are running.
- **Round 11 committed** (`8f82316`): self-contained MQuAKE slices (train 500 / dev 100, v3), development payload builder and
  execution mode for the cell driver (materialized base copy, checkpoint-identity helper), exposure trace audit (no
  certified releases; MQuAKE ≤ 2,829 subjects even if every review candidate cleared), freeze candidate v1 (dry).
- **Round 10 committed** (`3e8a980`): register v4 + MQuAKE exposure supplement, composition endpoint module, Stage 4 cell
  driver with all comparator adapters, three-dataset analysis. MQuAKE capacity deficit found (2,100 distinct candidate
  subjects vs 4,050 needed under conservative reservations) → R1-D4b.
- **MQuAKE reader**: proposed primary v4 (three pools; `primary_condition_v4.json`): zsRE 0.95–0.98, CounterFact 0.76–0.83,
  MQuAKE 0.56–0.79 (seed-sensitive); DEC-046/047 proposed defaults.
- **Round 9 committed by Codex** (`678c703`): analysis adapter (R1-57), draw recipe dry-run (R1-58), protocol v2 (R1-59, 360 cells),
  counter-review (R1-X8; cache repair applied), MQuAKE preparation (R1-D4: 6,043 items, composition inventory).
- **Round 8 committed** (`c401f55`): Stage 4 protocol draft (R1-49, gates U01–U18), frozen register binding
  (R1-D1f, `exclusions_frozen_v3.json`), ordinary-text null spec (R1-50b), R1-24 review (R1-X7; qualifications applied
  to the notes).
- **DEC-045**: MQuAKE-CF is the third dataset (`assets/data/raw/mquake/`); CounterFact stays (which needs the DEC-042
  exception). DEC-043 accepted, DEC-044 keeps the full matrix (now 360 cells). Then the freeze (R1-41). No draw, seal or launch before those.
- Rules unchanged (§ top); Codex: new files only, CPU only, no sealed payloads, no real-base execution; edit requests
  as patches under `docs/tasks/`. Tests under `tests/revision_v1/` (CPU) must pass.

- **Round 16 committed** (`2e7ac38`, 2026-09-16): R1-X12 selection review (42 candidates, 15 admissible, unique winner;
  zsRE unseen 10/100, Wilson 95 % 5.5–17.4 %; occupancy flatness unproved because the outside sets differ), R1-68c
  instrumented driver with batched drift (owner re-profile running), R1-72 schedule scenarios (331–452 GPU h vs 306
  available), HT-1b v5 tail audit (v5 zsRE mean +0.0022 nats but max 8.7 nats and 17 positions > 0.1; CounterFact
  +0.006## 3. Lanes for Codex — round 22 (CPU; open now; posted 2026-09-17 08:45 EDT) — the evidence the freeze needs

Round 21 is committed and mirrored. Your R1-D9 producers refuse, correctly, on absent review evidence and receipts.
Round 22 produces that evidence, so the lead's acts can happen on September 18–19. Priority order:
**R1-D10a → R1-D10b → R1-D10c → R1-58d → HT-4d → HT-3e.** The existing-file rule is lifted for your own round-19–21
files (no simultaneous edits to files the orchestrator is running: the drivers and builders in use by chains K–M).

### Lane R1-D10a — alias / context / exposure review evidence over register v6 (first)

Produce the unsealed review resource `r1_d9_clearance` expects (`d9.clearance.evidence`): one disposition row for
every v6 candidate item in all three datasets (nominal 52,411 / 12,246 / 4,218), with `alias_clear`, `context_clear`,
`exposure_clear` from actual checks — alias equivalence against every exposed subject / entity (register reasons,
training pools, development slices, the historical 700 MQuAKE rows, the R1-76b population), context limits against the
final base (`model_limits` from the tokenizer / config), cumulative exposure current as of the round-21 commit — and
`cross_dataset_disjoint` enforced by global entity id. Rows not reviewed under a declared outcome-independent policy
(if you must bound the work: review in register order until each dataset has ≥ 1.5 × its 4,050 demand cleared, and
mark the rest `exclude: not_reviewed_bounded_policy`) are excluded with that reason. `teacher_pass` / `tokens_pass`
are left for R1-D10b's binding. Write the `evidence_bindings` for the alias / context / exposure reviews and a CPU
script that reproduces the resource from the register and the bound inputs. Tests on a small synthetic register.

### Lane R1-D10b — teacher-token review on the final base (script for the orchestrator's GPU run)

The clearance evidence needs `teacher_pass` (base answers the edit prompt incorrectly under the E.2 greedy rule) and
`tokens_pass` (answer / prompt / paraphrase token limits) on the **final base identity**. Write
`scripts/r1_d10b_teacher_review.py`: batched greedy decoding of the base over the R1-D10a-eligible rows per dataset
(reuse `pccap.harness.stage_s2` / the R1-D3 E.2 filter and `r1_d5_mquake_teacher` logic; one lease; MemAvailable
guard; resumable by dataset; progress receipts), producing the evidence binding with `base_tensor_sha256`,
`tokenizer_sha256` and per-row `teacher_pass` / `tokens_pass` merged into the dispositions. Estimate the cost (rows ×
decode) and state it; the orchestrator runs it after chain M.

### Lane R1-D10c — endpoint construction and the composition catalog

From a draw receipt (test on the R1-D9b dry structure and on the development slices): construct the near-miss rows
(`edit_item_id` + `neighbour_item_id` from the reserved near / neighbour roles), the revision facts, the outside prompts,
the composition catalog for MQuAKE (from the verified multi-hop inventory: cases whose dependencies are all in the
realization's edits) and the `independent_population` resource (planned denominators per coordinate, fixed before
observations), in the exact shapes `r1_d9_seal` validates. `--dry-run`; tests.

### Lane R1-58d — populated inputs and authorization templates for the lead

`docs/tasks/R1-D9-inputs-v2.json` populated for the real run (register v6, matrix v5.1, protocol v5.1, calibration v3,
stage configurations, evidence and catalog bindings as they land), plus the three authorization documents as
templates the lead completes by setting `lead_approved: true` and the master seed after the dry-run shows the
`request_sha256`. A one-page operator sheet: the exact order of commands, what each dry-run must show, what the lead
signs. The orchestrator runs the dry-runs and hands the lead the sheet.

### Lane HT-4d — claim ledger v4 (as posted in round 21)

### Lane HT-3e — counter-review of the κ pilot and the stress-panel filing (as posted in round 21)

## 4. Interfaces and coordination

As before: `pccap.contracts`, `pccap.bases.gpt2_jax`, `pccap.bases.bp.BPBase`, `pccap.harness.arms.make_learner/
router_for`, `pccap.harness.runs`, `pccap.harness.stage_s2.load_dev_items`, `pccap.data.tokenize`, `pccap.data.decode`,
`pccap.harness.ledger.Ledger`, `pccap.harness.lease.gpu_lease`, the grammar modules, `pccap.analysis.s7_01`,
`pccap.analysis.s1_p4`. Questions for the orchestrator: a dated line under "## Agent questions" in
`docs/lead_queue.md`; board rows: your own only (the orchestrator mirrors completion records it finds).
